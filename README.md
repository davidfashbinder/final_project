# Baseball Statistics - Beyond the Batter's Box

## Overview:
We will be analyzing a wide variety of data focused on Major League Baseball teams.  The goal will be to create a machine learning model, functional database, and compelling presentation so that we can answer many different questions that may be asked, such as: 
1. What team is likely to win the World Series based on price per hit in a given season?
2. Do teams that spend more money have greater success?
3. Does a team need a certain number of players performing at elite levels in order to win?

This topic was selected not just for our love of baseball, but because America's Pasttime has been around for over 120 years, and has an immense volume of data available for a machine learning model to incorporate.  Between fans of the game, historians, front-office types, and gamblers, there will always be people interested in this data and the answers it holds.  

We're leveraging an amazing open-source data center for Major League Baseball, the Lahman Database, which can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.  Each zip file contains CSV documents that cover topics of interest in baseball.  The data goes back all the way to 1871, so we can have confidence in the model's depth of information.
