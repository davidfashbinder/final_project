# Baseball Statistics - Beyond the Batter's Box

## Overview:
We will be analyzing a wide variety of data focused on Major League Baseball teams.  The goal will be to create a machine learning model, functional database, and compelling presentation that can answer a large range of questions.  

## Why Baseball?
This topic was selected not just for our love of baseball, but because America's Pasttime has been around for over 120 years, and has an immense volume of data available for a machine learning model to incorporate.  Between fans of the game, historians, front-office types, and gamblers, there will always be people interested in this data and the answers it holds.  

## Data Source
We're leveraging an amazing open-source data center for Major League Baseball, the Lahman Database, which can be found here: http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.  Each zip file contains CSV documents that cover topics of interest in baseball.  The data goes back all the way to 1871, so we can have confidence in the model's depth of information.

## Questions we hope to answer 
Utilizing baseball statistics allows for many options in finding out possible batting averages, salaries and their roles in the success of teams, team data, home runs and RBIs. Another option would be stolen bases or runs scored. 
This detailed information and data set enables possibly even guessing who could be in the 2021 World Series. It would be based solely on past information to predict future outcomes, but it would be a fun exercise.

### Example questions
A good example of how we can look into the why behind salary information its role in successful teams.
For example the 2020 Tampa Bay Rays was the lowest paid team in Major League Baseball (MLB). They ended up being American League East Division champions, then won the entire American League and then we to the 2020 World Series. Their story was very interesting on many levels and could be a great example of what we can dive into for the this final project. 

### Example questions 2 
Which pitching statistics play a role on individual players like Clayton Kershaw and his role in the Dodgers. The LA Dodgers have a very different make up than the Tampa Bay Rays pitchers but both teams ultimately could have won the World Series, and have in past years. 


## How will we design the model

Based on the data we can perform linear regression (continuous outcomes) or logistic regression (binary outcomes)

Example lin regress databases: Stocks, Salaries, Reviews of media
Examples log regress: Has diabetes or no, Is fraud or no, Successful Sports team or no

For continuous data
SVM

For categorical data

Random Forest
- Great for listing out what the machine weighs heavily for each feature
