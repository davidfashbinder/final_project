# Instructions to Load database

- Use PgAdmin to Create New DataBase Named **BaseBall_Project** in your main server instance in Postgres.

### Copy the files listed below to the same folder you will be running the **Loading and Cleaning** Jupyter Notebook file from
    (or you can fix the path in the loading csv to dataFrame steps to reflect the location of these files)
    
    
    - Teams.csv
    - AllStarFull.csv
    - People.csv
    - AwardsPlayers.csv
    - Salaries.csv
    - Fielding.csv
    - Pitching.csv
    - Batting.csv
    - Managers.csv


### Load Jupyter notebook so you can access and edit the **Loading and Cleaning" JupterNotebook. Browse to the cloned repository. 

**Note** You should access and edit the "loading and cleaning" from within Jupyter note book not from the repository.

#### Before running the "Load and Cleaning" notebook you will need to make changes to the connection string (engine) in the jupyter notebook file. 

**engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:Superman78@127.0.0.1:5432/BaseBall_Project')**

In the string above you will need to update the **postgres:Superman78** with your usename:password. *postgres is the default user if you did not create a new user account when setting up PgAdmin. 

**NOTE** This same connection will be used to pull data from the database. 

Once you have updated the engine string click to save the changes.

### You are now ready to step through the saved Jupyter notebook "Cleaning and Learning" to create and populate the tables in our dataBase for use with the ML model. 


To Test success uncomment the last input and run the command. You can change the table name test other tables. It should return the contents of the table listed.
