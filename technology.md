# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and and we will integrate PgAdmin to display the data as well as the ERD.

## Machine Learning
RandomForest is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is still being decided but will be using Pandas. Extra ML verbiage here.
We are looking to attempt 80% accuracy with our final project. 

## Dashboard
The dashboard is still being worked on for the final project but, we will also integrate for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau.
