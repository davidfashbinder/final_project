# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. The data we are using is baseball statistics dating back almost 200 years. 

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and and we will integrate using PgAdmin to display the data as well as an ERD. 

## Machine Learning
RandomForest is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is still being decided but will be using Pandas. Extra ML verbiage here.
We are looking to attempt 80% accuracy with our final project. 

## Dashboard
The dashboard is still being worked on for the final project but, we will also integrate for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau.
