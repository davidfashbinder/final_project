# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python. The data we are using is baseball statistics dating back almost 200 years. 

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and and we will integrate using PgAdmin to display the data as well as an ERD. 

## Machine Learning
RandomForest is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is still being decided but will be using Pandas. Extra ML verbiage here.
We are looking to attempt 80% accuracy with our final project. 

## Dashboard
The dashboard is still being worked on for the final project but, we will also integrate for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau.

## Questions we hope to answer. 
Utilizing baseball statistics allows for many options in finding out possible batting averages, salaries and their roles in the success of teams, team data, home runs and RBIs. Another option would be stolen bases or runs scored. 
This detailed information and data set enables possibly even guessing who could be in the 2021 World Series. It would be based solely on past information to predict future outcomes, but it would be a fun exercise.

### Example questions
A good example of how we can look into the why behind salary information its role in successful teams.
For example the 2020 Tampa Bay Rays was the lowest paid team in Major League Baseball (MLB). They ended up being American League East Division champions, then won the entire American League and then we to the 2020 World Series. Their story was very interesting on many levels and could be a great example of what we can dive into for the this final project. 

#### Example questions 2 
What pitching statistics play a role on individual players like Clayton Kershaw and his role in the Dodgers. The LA Dodgers have a very different make up than the Tampa Bay Rays pitchers but both teams ultimately could have won the World Series, and have in past years.
