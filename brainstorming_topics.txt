Brainstorming Databases and Learning Models

Based on the data we can perform linear regression (continuous outcomes) or logistic regression (binary outcomes)

Example lin regress databases: Stocks, Salaries, Reviews of media
Examples log regress: Has diabetes or no, Is fraud or no, Successful Sports team or no

For categorical data

Random Forest
- Great for listing out what the machine weighs heavily for each feature

Technologies
Jupyter notebook
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Mock Model

1. Choose our dataset
2. Clean the data set and preprocess for Machine Learning
3. Split data into training and testing data
4. Scale the data
5. Fitting the data to the model we choose
6. Retrieve the results
7. Optimize the results if necessary
